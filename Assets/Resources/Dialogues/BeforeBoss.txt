As soon As he caught the grail, the memories returned...
...Arghh!!
...finally, I...remembered what happened to me.
...It's not a saint, but a sorcerer who killed me.
...Am I really going to give this to him?
...Well! now GIVE ME THAT!
...No! Now I remember everything.
...You are not a saint but a evil sorcerer.
...Well well, what next? Can you defeat me?
...You won't get any drop of elixir from me!
...(You drink the elixir)
...What have you done!
...I will kill you!
...(I can feel the power inside me)
