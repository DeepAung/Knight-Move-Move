First, your remaining move count is on the left-buttom. And on right-top is a map number.
As you can see your move count is not enough to go to the goal. you need to collect a potion to increase your move count.
So sad, but you cannot go that path any more, let's go down.
In front of you is a breakable object. when you move to that cell, the object will be broken(you will lose 1 move count).
This is a movable object. you can push away to clear your path(lose 1 move count too).
Let's get another potion!
Careful! in front of you is a spike. it'll decrease your move count by 1.
On your top is not a normal spike. it's a swappable. every time you move, it'll swap in and out.
Try to break the object that is on your left. it might help.
Congratulations, you've just finished the tutorial. now you are ready for adventure!!!
