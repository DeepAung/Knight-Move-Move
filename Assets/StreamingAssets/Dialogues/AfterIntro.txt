???: ARISE!
Holy Saint: You were resurrected by me the Holy Saint.
You: Why am I being resurrected?
Holy Saint: I have mercy on you, so I have done it.
You: But why am I a Skeleton?
Holy Saint: Because my Power is still unable to make you completely human.
Holy Saint: I will entrust you with a mission to bring the holy water "Elixir" to save all lives and bring you back to be fully human.
You: Where?
Holy Saint: In the dungeon where you are now. Watch out for traps, GOOD LUCK...
