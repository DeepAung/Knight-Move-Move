ARISE!
You were resurrected by me the Holy Saint.
Why am I being resurrected?
I have mercy on you, so I have done it.
But why am I a Skeleton?
Because my Power is still unable to make you completely human.
I will entrust you with a mission to bring the holy water "Elixir" to save all lives and bring you back to be fully human.
Where?
In the dungeon where you are now. Watch out for traps, GOOD LUCK...
